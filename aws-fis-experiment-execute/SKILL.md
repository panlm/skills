# AWS FIS Experiment Execute

Verify that infrastructure is already deployed, run an AWS FIS experiment,
monitor its progress, and generate a results report. Reads configuration from
a prepared experiment directory whose CloudFormation stack has already been
deployed.

## Output Language Rule

Detect the language of the user's conversation and use the **same language** for all output.
- Chinese input -> Chinese output
- English input -> English output

## Prerequisites

Required tools:
- **AWS CLI** — `aws fis`, `aws cloudwatch`, `aws cloudformation`
- A prepared experiment directory (from aws-fis-experiment-prepare skill)
- The CloudFormation stack for this experiment **must already be deployed**

## Workflow

```dot
digraph execute_flow {
    "Load experiment directory" [shape=box];
    "Validate files" [shape=box];
    "Read README for stack name" [shape=box];
    "Check CFN stack status" [shape=diamond];
    "Extract template ID from outputs" [shape=box];
    "User confirms experiment start" [shape=diamond, style=bold, color=red];
    "Start experiment" [shape=box];
    "Monitor experiment" [shape=box];
    "Experiment complete?" [shape=diamond];
    "Generate results report" [shape=box];

    "Load experiment directory" -> "Validate files";
    "Validate files" -> "Read README for stack name";
    "Read README for stack name" -> "Check CFN stack status";
    "Check CFN stack status" -> "Extract template ID from outputs" [label="CREATE_COMPLETE"];
    "Check CFN stack status" -> "Generate results report" [label="Not deployed / failed, abort"];
    "Extract template ID from outputs" -> "User confirms experiment start";
    "User confirms experiment start" -> "Start experiment" [label="Yes, I confirm"];
    "User confirms experiment start" -> "Generate results report" [label="No, abort"];
    "Start experiment" -> "Monitor experiment";
    "Monitor experiment" -> "Experiment complete?";
    "Experiment complete?" -> "Monitor experiment" [label="No, poll again"];
    "Experiment complete?" -> "Generate results report" [label="Yes"];
}
```

### Step 1: Load and Validate Experiment Directory

The user provides the path to the experiment directory. Verify it contains the
required files:

```bash
EXPERIMENT_DIR="{USER_PROVIDED_PATH}"

# Required files
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/experiment-template.json"
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/iam-policy.json"
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/cfn-template.yaml"
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/README.md"

# Optional files
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/alarms/stop-condition-alarms.json" 2>/dev/null
ls "${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/alarms/dashboard.json" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Read README and Extract Stack Information

Read `README.md` from the experiment directory to extract:

1. **CFN Stack Name** — look for the line `**CFN Stack:** {STACK_NAME}` in the
   README header block (near the top, after the H1 heading). This is the stack
   name assigned by `aws-fis-experiment-prepare` during deployment.
2. **Scenario name** — from the H1 heading (e.g., `# FIS Experiment: AZ Power Interruption`)
3. **Target region** — from `**Region:** {REGION}`
4. **Target AZ** — from `**Target AZ:** {AZ_ID}` (if applicable)
5. **Estimated duration** — from `**Estimated Duration:** {DURATION}`
6. **Affected resources** — from the "Affected Resources" table

Present a summary to the user with all extracted information.

**If the CFN Stack Name cannot be found in the README**, stop and inform the
user that the stack name is missing. The experiment cannot proceed without it.

### Step 3: Check CloudFormation Stack Status

Using the stack name and region extracted from the README, verify the stack is deployed.
See `references/cli-commands.md` for CLI commands and stack status reference.

Only proceed if the stack is in a ready state (`CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE`).

**If the stack is not ready**, inform the user clearly:
- Show the current stack status and failure reason (if applicable)
- Suggest running `aws-fis-experiment-prepare` to deploy the stack
- Do NOT attempt to deploy the stack — this skill only checks and executes

### Step 4: Extract Experiment Template ID from Stack Outputs

Extract `ExperimentTemplateId` from stack outputs. See `references/cli-commands.md` for CLI commands.

**If `ExperimentTemplateId` is not found**, list all outputs and ask the user which one contains the template ID. Common alternatives: `FISExperimentTemplateId`, `TemplateId`.

Also extract dashboard URL and alarm ARNs if available.

### Step 5: Start Experiment (CRITICAL CONFIRMATION)

**This is the most dangerous step. The experiment WILL affect real resources.**

Before starting, present a clear warning:

```
WARNING: Starting this FIS experiment will cause REAL impact:

Scenario:    {SCENARIO_NAME}
Region:      {REGION}
Target AZ:   {AZ_ID}
Duration:    {DURATION}
Stack:       {STACK_NAME} (verified: CREATE_COMPLETE)
Template ID: {TEMPLATE_ID}

Resources that WILL be affected:
  - {list each affected resource type and count from README}

Stop Conditions:
  - {list each alarm that will stop the experiment}

Type "Yes, start experiment" to proceed, or "No" to abort.
```

**Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms.**

Save the returned `experiment.id`.

### Step 6: Monitor Experiment

Poll the experiment status and display progress. See `references/cli-commands.md` for
polling commands and experiment status reference.

**Polling strategy:**
- Poll every 30 seconds for the first 5 minutes
- Poll every 60 seconds after that
- Show current status after each poll
- **Record timestamps** for each status change and action state transition — these
  feed into the per-service timeline in the final report
- **Track per-service events**: For each service affected by the experiment, note when
  it was impacted (action started), when it recovered, and any intermediate states.
  Query service-specific status (e.g., RDS instance status, ElastiCache replication
  group status, EKS node status) during monitoring to capture detailed observations.

**During monitoring, remind the user:**
- Check the CloudWatch dashboard for real-time metrics
- The experiment can be stopped at any time (see `references/cli-commands.md` for stop command)

### Step 7: Save Results Report to Local File

After the experiment completes (any terminal state), generate a results report and
**write it directly to a local markdown file** instead of outputting the full content
to the terminal. Use the following file naming convention:

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S)
SCENARIO_SLUG=$(echo "{SCENARIO_NAME}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' :/' '-')
# File name: ${TIMESTAMP}-${SCENARIO_SLUG}-experiment-results.md
# Save the file in the experiment directory (${EXPERIMENT_DIR})
```

**Timeline emphasis:** Timestamps in the report header (Start Time, End Time) use full
ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., `2025-03-30T14:05:32+08:00`). However, in timeline tables
and action results, use **time-only format in UTC** (e.g., `05:05:32`) — the report date
is already in the header, so repeating the date on every row adds clutter. Mark the
column header as "Time (UTC)" so the timezone is clear. No milliseconds anywhere. Timeline events are embedded directly
into each service's impact analysis section — do NOT create a separate standalone
timeline section. This allows readers to see the full picture (timeline + impact +
findings) for each service without jumping between sections.

**Per-service analysis:** Identify all services affected by the experiment from the
README's "Affected Resources" table. For each service, create a sub-section under
"Per-Service Impact Analysis" that includes: (1) the timeline events relevant to that
service, (2) observed behavior from monitoring, (3) key findings. Also check for
indirectly affected services (e.g., MSK affected by network disruption) and include
them.

The results report file must include:

```markdown
## FIS Experiment Results

**Experiment ID:** {EXPERIMENT_ID}
**Template ID:**   {TEMPLATE_ID}
**Stack:**         {STACK_NAME}
**Status:**        {FINAL_STATUS}
**Start Time:**    {START_TIME}
**End Time:**      {END_TIME}
**Duration:**      {ACTUAL_DURATION}

### Action Results

| Action | Action ID | Status | Start (UTC) | End (UTC) | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {action_name} | {action_id} | {status} | {HH:MM:SS} | {HH:MM:SS} | {duration} |

### Stop Condition Alarms

| Alarm | Final Status |
|---|---|
| {alarm_name} | {OK/ALARM} |

### Per-Service Impact Analysis

For EACH service listed in the README's "Affected Resources" table, create a sub-section below.
Also include indirectly affected services (e.g., services impacted by network
disruption even without a dedicated FIS action).

#### {Service Name} ({resource_identifier})

| Time (UTC) | Event | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| {HH:MM:SS} | {event} | {what was observed at this point} |
| {HH:MM:SS} | {event} | {observed result / status change} |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Key Findings:**
- {finding_1 — what happened and why}
- {finding_2 — recovery behavior}

(Repeat for each service)

### Recovery Status Summary

| Resource | Recovery Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| {service} | {Recovered / Partially Recovered / Recovering} | {details} |

### Issues Requiring Attention

#### 1. {Issue title}
- **Problem:** {description}
- **Recommendation:** {action to take, with CLI command if applicable}

### Cleanup

{cleanup instructions with CLI commands — reference the stack name for CFN cleanup}
```

After saving the file, print a brief summary to the terminal listing only:
- The file path of the saved results report
- Experiment ID and final status
- Start time, end time, and duration (all timestamps in ISO 8601 with timezone)
- Per-action status (one line each)
- Per-service recovery status (one line each)
- Issues requiring attention (if any)
- Cleanup instructions

## Safety Rules

1. **Never auto-start experiments.** Always require explicit user confirmation.
2. **Show every CLI command** before executing it.
3. **Display impact warning** before experiment start with specific resource list.
4. **Provide abort instructions** at every step.
5. **Never delete resources** without user confirmation.
6. **Never deploy infrastructure.** This skill only checks existing deployments.
7. **Recommend dry-run first** — suggest the user review all files before starting.

## Cleanup Guide

After the experiment, offer cleanup. See `references/cli-commands.md` for cleanup commands.

- **CFN Cleanup (Recommended):** Delete the stack to remove all resources
- **Manual Cleanup:** Delete individual resources if they exist outside the stack

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Stack name not found in README | README missing `**CFN Stack:**` field | Check if the experiment was prepared with a recent version of aws-fis-experiment-prepare |
| Stack not found (`ValidationError`) | Stack does not exist or was deleted | Deploy the stack first using aws-fis-experiment-prepare |
| Stack in `CREATE_FAILED` / `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` | Stack deployment failed | Check stack events for failure reason, fix and redeploy |
| `ExperimentTemplateId` not in outputs | Stack template missing output | Check cfn-template.yaml for the output definition |
| `AccessDeniedException` | Insufficient permissions | Check IAM permissions for FIS, CloudWatch, CloudFormation |
| `ResourceNotFoundException` on targets | Tagged resources not found | Verify resource tags match experiment template |
| Experiment stuck in `initiating` | IAM role propagation delay | Wait 30 seconds and check again |
