  Use when the user wants to run a prepared AWS FIS experiment where the
  CloudFormation stack has already been deployed. Triggers on "execute FIS
  experiment", "run FIS experiment", "start chaos experiment", "启动 FIS 实验",
  "运行混沌实验", "执行故障注入实验", "run the experiment in [directory]",
  or when the user provides an FIS experiment template ID (e.g. EXT1a2b3c4d5e6f7).
  Does NOT deploy infrastructure — only checks that it is already deployed.

# AWS FIS Experiment Execute

Verify that infrastructure is already deployed, run an AWS FIS experiment,
monitor its progress, and generate a results report. Reads configuration from
a prepared experiment directory whose CloudFormation stack has already been
deployed.

## Output Language Rule

Detect the language of the user's conversation and use the **same language** for all output.
- Chinese input -> Chinese output
- English input -> English output

## Prerequisites

Required tools:
- **AWS CLI** — `aws fis`, `aws cloudwatch`, `aws cloudformation`, `aws logs`
- **kubectl** (optional) — configured with access to target EKS cluster. If not available,
  application log collection is skipped but managed service logs are still collected.
- A prepared experiment directory (from aws-fis-experiment-prepare skill)
- The CloudFormation stack for this experiment **must already be deployed**

## Workflow

}
```

### Step 1: Resolve and Validate Experiment Directory

The user provides either:
- **(a)** the full path to the experiment directory, OR
- **(b)** an FIS experiment template ID (e.g., `EXT1a2b3c4d5e6f7`)

#### Step 1a: Resolve directory from template ID

If the user provides a template ID, search CWD for directories ending with that ID:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "*${TEMPLATE_ID_INPUT}" 2>/dev/null
```

- **1 match** → use it, inform user
- **Multiple matches** → list and ask user to choose
- **No match** → ask user for full path. Do NOT proceed without a valid path.

#### Step 1b: Validate required files

Verify `EXPERIMENT_DIR` contains: `experiment-template.json`, `iam-policy.json`,
`cfn-template.yaml`, `README.md`. Optional: `alarms/stop-condition-alarms.json`,
`alarms/dashboard.json`.

### Step 2: Read README and Extract Stack Information

Read `README.md` from the experiment directory to extract:

1. **CFN Stack Name** — look for the line `**CFN Stack:** {STACK_NAME}` in the
   README header block (near the top, after the H1 heading). This is the stack
   name assigned by `aws-fis-experiment-prepare` during deployment.
2. **Scenario name** — from the H1 heading (e.g., `# FIS Experiment: AZ Power Interruption`)
3. **Target region** — from `**Region:** {REGION}`
4. **Target AZ** — from `**Target AZ:** {AZ_ID}` (if applicable)
5. **Estimated duration** — from `**Estimated Duration:** {DURATION}`
6. **Affected resources** — from the "Affected Resources" table

Present a summary to the user with all extracted information.

**If the CFN Stack Name cannot be found in the README**, stop and inform the
user that the stack name is missing. The experiment cannot proceed without it.

### Step 3: Check CloudFormation Stack Status

Using the stack name and region extracted from the README, verify the stack is deployed.
See `references/cli-commands.md` for CLI commands and stack status reference.

Only proceed if the stack is in a ready state (`CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE`).

**If the stack is not ready**, inform the user clearly:
- Show the current stack status and failure reason (if applicable)
- Suggest running `aws-fis-experiment-prepare` to deploy the stack
- Do NOT attempt to deploy the stack — this skill only checks and executes

### Step 4: Extract Experiment Template ID from Stack Outputs

Extract `ExperimentTemplateId` from stack outputs. See `references/cli-commands.md` for CLI commands.

**If `ExperimentTemplateId` is not found**, list all outputs and ask the user which one contains the template ID. Common alternatives: `FISExperimentTemplateId`, `TemplateId`.

Also extract dashboard URL and alarm ARNs if available.

### Step 5: Display Experiment Actions

Read `experiment-template.json` from the experiment directory. Extract all `actionId`
values from the `actions` map and display them to the user:

```
Actions found:
  - {actionId_1}
  - {actionId_2}
  ...
```

Proceed directly to Step 6 (log collection is always enabled).

### Step 6: Discover EKS Applications and Start Log Collection

**REQUIRED:** You MUST load the `app-service-log-analysis` skill at this point. It contains
the detailed procedures for multi-cluster discovery, kubeconfig isolation, application
dependency deep-scan, and log collection. Load it now and execute its steps as described
below.

This step runs **BEFORE** the experiment starts — discovering applications after the
experiment begins risks missing early log entries that get rotated or overwritten.

#### kubectl Availability Check

Before starting app log collection, verify that `kubectl` is available:

```bash
kubectl version --client --short 2>/dev/null
```

**If kubectl is NOT available:**
- Skip app discovery and app log collection
- **Still execute `app-service-log-analysis` Step 3.5 (Detect and Collect Managed
  Service Logs)** — this only requires AWS CLI, not kubectl
- Inform the user:
  ```
  kubectl not available — skipping application log collection.
  Managed service logs (EKS control plane, RDS, etc.) will still be collected.
  ```

**If kubectl IS available**, execute from `app-service-log-analysis` skill:

1. **Its "Multi-Cluster EKS Discovery and Kubeconfig Isolation" section** — discovers
   all EKS clusters in the target region, generates isolated kubeconfig per cluster
   (never overwrites `~/.kube/config`), verifies access to each cluster
2. **Its Step 3 (Collect Application Dependencies — Deep Scan)** — resolves service
   endpoints, deep-scans all accessible clusters in parallel, confirms discovered
   dependencies with user
3. **Its Step 3.5 (Detect and Collect Managed Service Logs)** — checks managed service
   CloudWatch logging status, records log groups for later analysis
4. **Its Step 4 (Log Collection — Real-time Mode)** — starts background `kubectl logs -f`
   for all confirmed applications across all clusters

### Step 7: Start Experiment (CRITICAL CONFIRMATION)

**This is the most dangerous step. The experiment WILL affect real resources.**

Before starting, present a clear warning:

```
WARNING: Starting this FIS experiment will cause REAL impact:

Scenario:    {SCENARIO_NAME}
Region:      {REGION}
Target AZ:   {AZ_ID}
Duration:    {DURATION}
Stack:       {STACK_NAME} (verified: CREATE_COMPLETE)
Template ID: {TEMPLATE_ID}

Resources that WILL be affected:
  - {list each affected resource type and count from README}

Stop Conditions:
  - {list each alarm that will stop the experiment}

Applications being monitored:
  - {list each namespace/deployment from SERVICE_APP_MAP, or "N/A (kubectl not available)" if skipped}

Managed service log collection:
  - {list each service with logging status from Step 6}

Log directory: {LOG_DIR}
Post-experiment baseline: 3 minutes (automatic)

Type "Yes, start experiment" to proceed, or "No" to abort.
```

**Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms.** If user aborts, proceed to Step 9
to stop log collection and clean up first.

Save the returned `experiment.id`.

### Step 8: Monitor Experiment

Poll the experiment status and display progress. See `references/cli-commands.md` for
polling commands and experiment status reference.

**Polling strategy:**
- Poll every 30 seconds for the first 5 minutes
- Poll every 60 seconds after that
- Show current status after each poll
- **Record timestamps** for each status change and action state transition — these
  feed into the per-service timeline in the final report
- **Track per-service events**: For each service affected by the experiment, note when
  it was impacted (action started), when it recovered, and any intermediate states.
  Query service-specific status (e.g., RDS instance status, ElastiCache replication
  group status, EKS node status) during monitoring to capture detailed observations.

**Log insights during each poll cycle:** Execute `app-service-log-analysis` Step 5
(Real-time Monitoring Display) — read recent logs, count errors/warnings, display
per-app summary, detect recovery signals. If app log collection was skipped (kubectl
not available), show only managed service log status. The skill must already be loaded
from Step 6.

**During monitoring, remind the user:**
- Check the CloudWatch dashboard for real-time metrics
- The experiment can be stopped at any time (see `references/cli-commands.md` for stop command)

### Step 9: Post-Experiment Baseline, Stop Log Collection and Analyze

After the experiment completes (any terminal state):

#### Post-Experiment Baseline (3 minutes)

Continue collecting logs for **3 minutes** after the experiment ends to capture
recovery behavior. This applies to both application logs (if kubectl is available)
and managed service logs. Display a countdown to the user:

```
Experiment completed. Collecting post-experiment baseline logs...
Remaining: {countdown} (3 minutes total)
```

After the 3-minute baseline window ends, proceed to analysis.

#### Generate Application Log Analysis

Execute `app-service-log-analysis` Steps 7-8 (skill already loaded from Step 6):
- **Its Step 7 (Generate Analysis Report)** — analyze error patterns, peak rates, recovery
  times, and generate the "Application Log Analysis" section of the report. The analysis
  time window extends 3 minutes past the experiment end time to cover the baseline period.
- **Its Step 8 (Cleanup)** — kill background `kubectl logs` processes (if any were started)

The application log analysis output is embedded into the experiment results report
(see Step 10 below), NOT saved as a separate file.

### Step 10: Save Results Report to Local File

After the experiment completes (any terminal state), generate a results report and
**write it directly to a local markdown file** in the experiment directory.

See `references/report-template.md` for the complete report structure, file naming
convention, and timestamp format rules.

**Per-service analysis:** Identify all services affected by the experiment from the
README's "Affected Resources" table. For each service, create a sub-section with:
(1) timeline events, (2) observed behavior, (3) key findings. Include indirectly
affected services.

After saving, print a brief terminal summary:
- File path, experiment ID, final status
- Start/end time and duration (ISO 8601 with timezone)
- Per-action status (one line each)
- Per-service recovery status (one line each)
- Application log summary — total errors per app (or "N/A — kubectl not available")
- Issues requiring attention (if any)
- Cleanup instructions

## Safety Rules

1. **Never auto-start experiments.** Always require explicit user confirmation.
2. **Show every CLI command** before executing it.
3. **Display impact warning** before experiment start with specific resource list.
4. **Provide abort instructions** at every step.
5. **Never delete resources** without user confirmation.
6. **Never deploy infrastructure.** This skill only checks existing deployments.
7. **Recommend dry-run first** — suggest the user review all files before starting.

## Cleanup Guide

After the experiment, offer cleanup. See `references/cli-commands.md` for commands.

## Error Handling

| `AccessDeniedException` | Insufficient permissions | Check IAM permissions for FIS, CloudWatch, CloudFormation |
| `ResourceNotFoundException` on targets | Tagged resources not found | Verify resource tags match experiment template |
| Experiment stuck in `initiating` | IAM role propagation delay | Wait 30 seconds and check again |
| `kubectl: command not found` | kubectl not installed | Install kubectl and configure kubeconfig |
| `error: You must be logged in` | kubeconfig not configured | Run `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name {cluster}` |
| `/.pids: Permission denied` | `LOG_DIR` variable empty due to `&&` chain | Use multi-line script with `export LOG_DIR=...`, NOT `&&` chains |
| No EKS apps discovered | No pods reference affected service endpoints | Ask user to manually specify namespace/deployment pairs |
