# AWS FIS Experiment Prepare

An agent skill that generates all configuration files needed to run an AWS FIS (Fault Injection Service) experiment, then **deploys via CloudFormation with self-healing iteration** until the stack succeeds.

## Problem Statement

Preparing an AWS FIS experiment manually involves several error-prone, tedious steps:

- **Resource-action compatibility is non-obvious** — e.g., `aws:rds:failover-db-cluster` requires an Aurora cluster (`aws:rds:cluster`), not a standalone RDS instance. Mismatches are only discovered at experiment start time, wasting all prior setup effort.
- **Multiple files must be generated and kept consistent** — experiment template JSON, IAM policy, CloudFormation template, CloudWatch alarms, and dashboard all reference the same resource ARNs and parameters.
- **CloudFormation deployments frequently fail** — property validation errors, IAM propagation delays, and region-specific resource limitations require iterative debugging that is slow and frustrating to do manually.
- **Scenario Library scenarios are complex** — composite scenarios (e.g., AZ Power Interruption) orchestrate multiple sub-actions with specific tag requirements and target types that are easy to misconfigure.
- **Scenario Library templates cannot be generated via API** — unlike custom single FIS actions, the 4 Scenario Library scenarios have no CLI/API command to auto-generate their experiment templates. The JSON template must be extracted from AWS documentation.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Identifies the scenario** — Determines whether the user wants a Scenario Library pre-built scenario (AZ Power Interruption, AZ Application Slowdown, etc.) or a custom single FIS action.
2. **Reads Scenario Library documentation** — For Scenario Library scenarios, reads the AWS documentation page to extract the JSON experiment template (these cannot be generated via API). The documentation URLs are:
   - [AZ Power Interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/fis/latest/userguide/az-availability-scenario.html)
   - [AZ Application Slowdown](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/fis/latest/userguide/az-application-slowdown-scenario.html)
   - [Cross-AZ Traffic Slowdown](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/fis/latest/userguide/cross-az-traffic-slowdown-scenario.html)
   - [Cross-Region Connectivity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/fis/latest/userguide/cross-region-scenario.html)
3. **Discovers target resources** — Queries the user's actual AWS resources and collects target identifiers.
3. **Validates compatibility** — Inspects actual resources via AWS CLI (e.g., `describe-db-instances`, `describe-db-clusters`) and cross-checks against FIS action `resourceType` requirements before generating any files.
4. **Determines monitoring configuration** — Defaults to `source: "none"` (no stop condition alarm). Only creates CloudWatch alarms if the user explicitly provides one. Generates a comprehensive CloudWatch dashboard with per-service availability, performance, and error/latency metrics.
5. **Reads CFN resource documentation** — Before generating the CFN template, reads the `AWS::FIS::ExperimentTemplate` CloudFormation documentation to ensure the template uses the current property schema.
6. **Generates configuration files** — Produces a self-contained directory with 2 files: CFN template and README.
7. **Deploys with self-healing** — Deploys the CFN template, and if deployment fails, automatically analyzes errors, fixes the template, deletes the failed stack, and retries (up to 5 times).
8. **Renames directory with template ID** — After successful deployment, appends the experiment template ID to the output directory name (e.g., `2026-04-11-pod-net-pktloss-payment-redis-EXT1a2b3c4d5e6f7/`) for easy identification.

## Supported Scenarios

### Scenario Library (Composite, Multi-Action)

| Scenario | Key Sub-Actions |
|---|---|
| AZ Availability: Power Interruption | EC2 stop, RDS failover, ElastiCache AZ power, EBS pause, network disruption |
| AZ: Application Slowdown | Pod network latency, EBS latency, network disruption |
| Cross-AZ: Traffic Slowdown | Cross-AZ network latency/packet-loss |
| Cross-Region: Connectivity | Cross-region network disruption |
| EC2 Stress | Instance failure, CPU, memory, disk, network latency |
| EKS Stress | Pod delete, CPU, disk, memory, network latency |
| EBS Latency | Sustained, increasing, intermittent, decreasing |

### Custom FIS Actions (Single Action)

Any valid FIS action ID, e.g.:
- `aws:rds:failover-db-cluster`
- `aws:ec2:stop-instances`
- `aws:elasticache:replicationgroup-interrupt-az-power`
- `aws:eks:pod-network-latency`

## Output Directory Structure

```
./{yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS}-{scenario-slug}-{target-slug}[-{context-slug}]-{TEMPLATE_ID}/
├── README.md                          # Experiment overview and execution instructions
└── cfn-template.yaml                  # All-in-one CloudFormation template
```

The optional `{context-slug}` distinguishes experiments with the same scenario and target
but different downstream services (e.g., `redis`, `msk`). Used for network fault injection
actions (latency, packet-loss, blackhole-port).

The `{TEMPLATE_ID}` is the FIS experiment template ID (e.g., `EXT1a2b3c4d5e6f7`), appended
after successful CFN deployment for easy identification.

Scenario slugs use standard abbreviations (e.g., `pod-net-pktloss`, `az-power-int`,
`ec-rg-az-power`) to keep CFN stack names and resource names concise. See SKILL.md Step 5
for the full abbreviation table.

## Resource-Action Compatibility Validation

A critical differentiator of this skill: it validates resource compatibility **before** generating any files.

| FIS Action | Required resourceType | Incompatible With |
|---|---|---|
| `aws:rds:failover-db-cluster` | `aws:rds:cluster` | Standalone RDS instances (non-Aurora) |
| `aws:rds:reboot-db-instances` | `aws:rds:db` | Aurora clusters (use failover instead) |
| `aws:elasticache:replicationgroup-interrupt-az-power` | `aws:elasticache:replicationgroup` | Standalone ElastiCache nodes |
| `aws:ec2:stop-instances` | `aws:ec2:instance` | Spot instances (may terminate instead) |
| `aws:eks:pod-network-latency` | `aws:eks:pod` | Clusters without required addon |

When incompatible, the skill explains the mismatch and suggests alternatives.

## Self-Healing CFN Deployment

After generating files, the skill immediately deploys the CloudFormation template:

1. **Permission pre-check** — Inspects the caller's IAM policy for a `cloudformation:RoleArn` condition on CreateStack/UpdateStack/DeleteStack. If found, extracts the required CFN Service Role ARN and adds `--role-arn` to all subsequent CFN commands. If no condition is found, uses IAM policy simulation (`simulate-principal-policy`) to verify the caller has CloudFormation permissions — stops early with guidance if permissions are missing.
2. **Validate** — `aws cloudformation validate-template`
3. **Deploy** — `aws cloudformation deploy --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` (with `--role-arn` if required)
4. **On failure** — Extract error from stack events, analyze root cause, fix template, delete failed stack, retry
5. **Max 5 retries** — Reports failure with all attempted fixes if still failing
6. **On success** — Updates local files with real ARNs from stack outputs

## Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI** (`aws`) — Resource discovery, FIS action validation, CFN deployment. Must have permissions for FIS, IAM, CloudWatch, CloudFormation.
- [**aws-knowledge-mcp-server**](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-knowledge-mcp-server) — Scenario Library documentation research (`aws___search_documentation`, `aws___read_documentation`)
- **jq** — JSON processing (optional but recommended)

**EKS Pod fault injection prerequisites:**
- EKS cluster authentication mode must be **`API_AND_CONFIG_MAP`** or **`API`**
  - Check with: `aws eks describe-cluster --name {CLUSTER} --query 'cluster.accessConfig.authenticationMode'`
  - If mode is `CONFIG_MAP` only, the user must update the cluster to `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP` first
- K8s RBAC resources (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding) are **automatically managed** via a Lambda-backed CFN Custom Resource — no manual `kubectl apply` is required
- The CFN template includes a Lambda function that performs idempotent creation of K8s RBAC resources (checks if they exist before creating). The Lambda uses `botocore.signers.RequestSigner` with `x-k8s-aws-id` header for EKS token generation — this is required for EKS API server authentication (plain `sts_client.generate_presigned_url` lacks this header and results in 401 Unauthorized). The `ensure_resource` helper includes logging and error checking to prevent silent failures.
- RBAC resources use **fixed standardized names** (`fis-sa`, `fis-experiment-role`, `fis-experiment-role-binding`) shared across all FIS experiments in the same namespace
- RBAC resources are **not deleted** when a stack is removed — they are shared and may be used by other experiments
- **MANDATORY:** When using any `aws:eks:pod-*` action, you MUST follow `references/eks-pod-action-prerequisites.md`

### Create a CloudFormation Service Role

This skill deploys CloudFormation stacks that create IAM roles, CloudWatch resources, and FIS experiment templates. Instead of using your own broad permissions, create a dedicated CloudFormation service role to limit the blast radius.

See the setup guide: https://panlm.github.io/others/cfn-service-role-for-fis-experiment-setup-guide/

Then pass `--role-arn` when deploying stacks:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file cfn-template.yaml \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/CloudFormationFISServiceRole \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region <region>
```

> **Benefit:** Your calling identity only needs `cloudformation:*` and `iam:PassRole` permissions. All resource creation is delegated to the service role, limiting the blast radius.

## Workflow Overview

```
Step 1: Identify scenario + region
         ↓
Step 2: Discover target resources
         ├── Scenario Library → MUST read AWS documentation first (JSON templates not available via API)
         └── Custom FIS action → query via `aws fis get-action`
         ↓
Step 2.5: EKS Pod prerequisites (if applicable)
         └── CFN template auto-includes Lambda + Custom Resource for K8s RBAC management
         ↓
Step 3: Validate resource-action compatibility [CRITICAL GATE]
         ├── Compatible → proceed
         └── Incompatible → suggest alternative → user confirms or abort
         ↓
Step 4: Determine monitoring config (stop conditions + dashboard metrics)
         ↓
Step 5: Generate 6 configuration files in output directory
         ↓
Step 5.5: CFN permission pre-check (detect cloudformation:RoleArn condition)
         ↓
Step 6: Deploy CFN template with self-healing loop (up to 5 retries)
         ├── ExperimentName includes random suffix → all physical resource names globally unique
         ├── On success → update local files with real ARNs
         └── On failure → report error with all attempted fixes
         ↓
Step 7: Rename output directory (append experiment template ID for easy identification)
```

## Usage Examples

```
"Prepare an AZ Power Interruption experiment for us-east-1a"
"Create FIS experiment for aws:rds:failover-db-cluster targeting my Aurora cluster"
"准备 FIS 实验，测试 AZ 断电对 EKS 和 RDS 的影响"
"Generate chaos experiment config for EC2 CPU stress"
"Set up fault injection test for ElastiCache failover in ap-southeast-1"
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Validate before generating.** Resource-action compatibility is checked before any files are produced. This avoids the common anti-pattern of generating a full configuration, deploying a stack, and only discovering the mismatch at experiment start.

2. **Scenario Library templates come from documentation.** The 4 Scenario Library scenarios (AZ Power Interruption, AZ Application Slowdown, Cross-AZ Traffic Slowdown, Cross-Region Connectivity) cannot be generated via FIS API. The skill reads the official AWS documentation pages to extract the JSON experiment template as the authoritative source for the correct multi-action template structure.

3. **Self-healing deployment loop.** CFN errors are analyzed and fixed automatically rather than reported to the user. The goal is a working, deployed experiment template — not just files that might work.

4. **All-in-one CFN template.** The `cfn-template.yaml` contains IAM role, alarms, dashboard, and experiment template. A single `cloudformation deploy` produces everything needed.

5. **Local files stay in sync.** After successful deployment, `experiment-template.json` and `README.md` are updated with real ARNs and stack outputs, so the directory is an accurate record of the deployed experiment.

6. **Never starts the experiment.** This skill only prepares and deploys infrastructure. Starting the actual experiment is handled by [aws-fis-experiment-execute](../aws-fis-experiment-execute/) or manually by the user.

7. **Directory name includes experiment template ID.** After successful deployment, the output directory is renamed to append the experiment template ID (e.g., `EXT1a2b3c4d5e6f7`), making it easy to identify which directory corresponds to which experiment.

8. **EKS RBAC via CFN Custom Resource.** K8s RBAC resources (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding) for EKS Pod actions are managed automatically by a Lambda-backed CFN Custom Resource. Uses fixed standardized names (`fis-sa`, `fis-experiment-role`, `fis-experiment-role-binding`) shared across all experiments in the same namespace. Lambda performs idempotent creation (skip if exists) and does NOT delete RBAC on stack removal, since other experiments may still depend on them. The Lambda uses `botocore.signers.RequestSigner` with `x-k8s-aws-id` header for EKS bearer token generation, which is required for proper EKS API server authentication.

9. **Naming convention prevents collisions.** `ExperimentName` includes a 6-character random suffix, making all CFN physical resource names (IAM Role, Dashboard, Alarm) globally unique. An optional `context-slug` in directory and resource names distinguishes experiments with the same scenario and target but different downstream services (e.g., `payment-redis` vs `payment-msk` for network fault injection).

10. **AZ Power Interruption: one Stack per AZ, shared tags.** The target AZ is hardcoded in multiple locations within the experiment template (filters, action parameters). To test a different AZ, delete the Stack and deploy a new one. Resource tags (`AzImpairmentPower`) do NOT distinguish AZ — the experiment template's internal AZ filters handle that. Tags are applied by a Lambda-backed Custom Resource within the same CFN Stack, requiring zero extra permissions on the EC2 Instance Profile. See `references/az-power-interruption-guide.md` for full details.

## Limitations

- Depends on AWS CLI access with sufficient permissions (FIS, IAM, CloudWatch, CloudFormation).
- Scenario Library documentation is read at execution time; newly added scenarios require re-running.
- Self-healing loop handles common CFN errors but may not resolve permission or account-level limits.
- Composite scenarios require resources to be pre-tagged with scenario-specific tags (e.g., `AzImpairmentPower: StopInstances`).
- Sequential MCP calls for documentation research take ~10-20 seconds.
