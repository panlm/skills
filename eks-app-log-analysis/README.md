# EKS App Log Analysis

An Agent Skill for analyzing EKS application logs during AWS FIS fault injection experiments to understand how applications respond to infrastructure failures.

## Problem Background

During BCP (Business Continuity Plan) drills with AWS FIS:

- **Service-level reports lack application perspective** — FIS experiment reports show AWS service behavior (RDS failover time, ElastiCache status) but not how applications actually responded
- **Manual log collection is tedious** — Correlating kubectl logs with experiment timelines requires manual effort
- **Dependency mapping is implicit** — When you disrupt RDS, you need to know which applications depend on it to collect relevant logs
- **Real-time visibility is limited** — During experiments, operators want to see application behavior as it happens, not just after

## Core Features

1. **Dual-mode operation** — Real-time monitoring during experiments OR post-hoc analysis after experiments
2. **Smart dependency discovery** — Reads experiment context and guides user to specify app-to-service dependencies
3. **Parallel log collection** — Background `kubectl logs -f` processes for multiple applications simultaneously, collecting only regular containers (excluding FIS-injected ephemeral containers)
4. **Live insight display** — Every 30 seconds: actual error logs (5 lines) + analysis insights per service group
5. **Comprehensive analysis report** — Error timelines, patterns, cross-service correlation, recovery analysis

## Workflow Overview

```
Mode Detection
├── Directory input → Real-time mode
│   ├── Read README.md for template ID
│   ├── Check if experiment is running
│   └── Start background log collection
└── Report file input → Post-hoc mode
    ├── Parse Start/End time from report
    └── Batch fetch historical logs

Common Steps
├── Read service list from expected-behavior.md or report
├── Ask user for dependent applications per service
├── Collect logs (background streaming or batch)
├── Display insights (real-time) or analyze (post-hoc)
└── Generate analysis report
```

```

## Analysis Report

The generated report includes:

- Experiment metadata (ID, time range, duration)
- Summary table: errors per application, peak error rate, recovery time
- Per-service application analysis:
  - Error timeline table
  - Key error patterns with counts
  - Actual log samples (5-10 lines)
  - Insights and correlation with fault injection events
- Cross-service correlation timeline
- Recommendations for improvement

## Prerequisites

- **kubectl** — Log collection. Must have access to target EKS cluster.
- **AWS CLI** — Query FIS experiment status (for real-time mode).
- **Experiment directory** — Context source, from aws-fis-experiment-prepare.
- **Experiment report** — Time range source, from aws-fis-experiment-execute.
- (Optional) **CloudWatch Container Insights** — Enables richer pod/node-level metrics for correlation. See [Enabling Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-EKS-quickstart.html).
- (Optional) **EKS Control Plane Logging** — Enables API server, audit, and scheduler logs for deeper analysis. See [Enabling Control Plane Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html).

## Usage Examples

```
# Real-time monitoring (during experiment)
"Analyze app logs for ./2026-03-31-az-power-interruption/"
"Monitor application behavior during the experiment"
"实时监控应用日志"

# Post-hoc analysis (after experiment)
"Analyze logs using ./2026-03-31-experiment-results.md"
"分析实验后的应用日志"
```

## Known Limitations

- Requires kubectl access to EKS cluster; logs not in cluster are not captured
- Pod restarts during experiment may cause log gaps (kubectl logs only shows current pod)
- FIS pod-level fault injection uses ephemeral containers — the skill explicitly excludes these to avoid noise in application logs
- For long-running experiments, consider using CloudWatch Logs Insights instead
- Real-time mode requires experiment to be running; if experiment completed, use post-hoc mode
